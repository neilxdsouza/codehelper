1. Program options - take database, portnumber, password, username as parameters - use boost where possible - almost done today itself
2. Toplogical sort of graph - so that we output the create table/ random data inputs in correct order  and drop functions also
3. Automatic search  -> for all tables, single reference, depth level 1, pull all search fields into search dialog
4. Automatic Edit/Update

6. Form chooser should transfer back text and value (ideally text should be 2nd field in table - ie. after primary key)
7. Automatic Insert
8. Play with layout of form using HBoxLayout, VBoxLayout , BoxLayout
9. Table list view - any single referenced field marked as view , we should search referenced table for fields marked as view and expose
